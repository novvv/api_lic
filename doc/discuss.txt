hello

@novvvster
can i explain you how the LRN and license work ?

novvvster [8:15 PM]
i here

anne [8:16 PM]
ok
there are two tables
one for LRN license
one for Switch licene
all the action related to : create new license, extend period, stop license , you need to insert it to the license server netchange table
there is a C program
that read those 2 tables , and update the real license DB accordingly
do you understand this part
then, you need to understand there are two kinds of licnese for switch :  per-port-per month and per-minute
and two kinds of license for LRN : per-port- per month  and per request
do you understand ?

novvvster [8:20 PM]
yes

anne [8:25 PM]
could you finish the remainign api for vladimir to finish UI ?
if you have any questino, pls ask me

novvvster [8:26 PM]
where is all endpoints needed?

anne [8:26 PM]
"all endpoints" mean?
do you want to see the invision?
would you like to take a look?

novvvster [8:28 PM]
vladimir ask about payments - it is not in the docs. so i need to manage client balance?
i not seen those invision

anne [8:34 PM]
for the pay port per month , the user pay XX amount for YY months, then you just extend the license period
no need to keep balance
for pay per request or pay per minute,
you keep track of how many remaining request or how many remaining minustes left
they pay and buy "remaining minute " or "remaining request"
you just need to deduct it regularly
the license DB has that usage data , you just need to deduct regularyly
@novvvster is it clear ?

novvvster [8:38 PM]
>> how many remaining minustes left....clear
but >> keep track of how many remaining request...

anne [8:38 PM]
yes , on a daily basic,

novvvster [8:38 PM]
how track requests?

anne [8:38 PM]
the license DB will write the usage of each switch_uuid to the DB
there you can read and deduct
i will get the exact table name
i forgot the very detail
but once i give you, it is clear
you just need to show daily usage in UI and deduct daily
it is ok, if they over use for one day
